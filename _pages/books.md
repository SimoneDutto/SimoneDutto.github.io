# My Bookshelf
<small>
Starting from my last bachelor year I decided to read more consistentitely. There are a lot of things I learn through book and I had a lot of fun.

Taking inspiration from this [website](https://petargyurov.com/bookshelf/) I found on HackerNews and thanks to the source code he provided I decided to get into the habit of tracking books into my personal blog.

It is a very useful way of tracking books when you read from different sources (public library, e-readers, bought books).
